This is the repository for an app I want to develop as a personal project.

The app has a single function: to provide lists with checkboxes that can be easily shared and edited by multiple people simultaneously.

For the front end, I will use Kotlin, the official language for Android, as it seems most suitable for this task.

For the back end, my research pointed me toward Firebase, which, based on what I’ve read, is optimized for mobile development and real-time data handling.

For the database, since I’ll be using Firebase, Firestore seems like the best choice.

I will use Android Studio as the IDE.

I’ll explore other technologies as I go. I’m open to guidance and advice; I’m still a junior, but my goal is to create this app to see the results of all the lessons and courses I’ve taken.

Design Completed!
The link to the Figma page is here. Even if the final result isn’t identical, I’ll be more than satisfied with something similar.
All the image components will be placed in a folder within the repository; they are all royalty-free.
